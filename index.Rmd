# Text Data 
_____


Text can be used for plotting. The plots however require  that we previously   do some particular operations on the text because words can have several inflections. In this session, you will see the construction of **word clouds**. These plots represent a variation of **bar plots** for categories, but are attractive to the eye to show word relevance.


1. Get the text:

Let me get a data frame with texts from some tweets:

```{r}
# clean memory
rm(list = ls()) 
link1="https://github.com/DACSS-Visual/basicText/"
link2="raw/main/trumps.csv"

trumpLink=paste0(link1,link2)
allTweets=read.csv(trumpLink ,stringsAsFactors = F)
```

The data has this columns:

```{r}
names(allTweets)
```
The Twitter text column has this information:

```{r}
head(allTweets$text,2)
```


2. Make some selection:

This data frame has some columns that allow subsetting. In this case, I will keeping tweets that are not retweets.

```{r}
SomeTrumpTweets=allTweets[allTweets$is_retweet==FALSE ,] 
SomeTrumpTweets=SomeTrumpTweets[,c(1,2)]
#some
head(SomeTrumpTweets,3)
```

3. Turn the text messages into words.

This process, also known as **tokenization**, will produce a simpler element from the input text, in this case words:

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidytext) 
library(magrittr) 
WordsIn_SomeTrumpTweets = SomeTrumpTweets %>%
                 unnest_tokens(output=EachWord, # column created
                               input=text,# input column from SomeTrumpTweets
                               token="words") # level of unnesting

# the date is the same for all the words coming from the
# same tweet:
head(WordsIn_SomeTrumpTweets,10) # notice 'EachWord'
```

You have these many 'words':

```{r}
nrow(WordsIn_SomeTrumpTweets) # count of words
```


4. Getting rid of **common words**: These are know as the _STOP WORDS_...

```{r}
# calling the file 
data(stop_words) # from library 'tidytext'
# seeing some 'STOP WORDS'  
head(stop_words)
```

Then, we  remove the stop words from the _EachWord_ column:

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)

 # The column 'word' from 'stop_words' will be compared # to the column 'EachWord' in 'WordsIn_SomeTrumpTweets' 
WordsIn_SomeTrumpTweets = WordsIn_SomeTrumpTweets %>%anti_join(stop_words,
                                             by = c("EachWord" = "word"))

# You have these many rows now:

nrow(WordsIn_SomeTrumpTweets) # less than 50%
```

5. Compute **frequency** of each word:

Here, you are simply producing a frequency table:

```{r}
forCloud=as.data.frame(table(WordsIn_SomeTrumpTweets$EachWord))
names(forCloud)=c('EachWord','Counts')
#sorting by count:
forCloud_ascending=forCloud[order(forCloud$Counts),]
```

Let's see the top and bottom of the data frame:

```{r}
head(forCloud_ascending,10)
```

```{r}
tail(forCloud_ascending,10)
```

Since you have a frequency table, you could prepare a barplot:

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(data=forCloud_ascending) + geom_bar(aes(x=reorder(EachWord,Counts), y=Counts), stat = 'identity') + coord_flip()
```

 
Text, especially from tweets or similar platforms, bring unexpected _words_, so you may need to manually perform some extra cleaning:
 
```{r}
# dropping by text:
badWords=c('https','t.co')
forCloud_ascending=forCloud_ascending[!forCloud_ascending$EachWord%in%badWords,]

# dropping by count:
forCloud_ascending=forCloud_ascending[forCloud_ascending$Counts>4,]
```
 
Checking the barplot again:

```{r}
ggplot(data=forCloud_ascending) + geom_bar(aes(x=reorder(EachWord,Counts), y=Counts), stat = 'identity') + coord_flip()
```



6. Create a word cloud:

Let's write the code to produce the cloud below.

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE}
library(ggwordcloud)

ggplot(forCloud_ascending, 
       aes(label = EachWord,
           size = Counts,color = Counts)) +
    geom_text_wordcloud_area() +
    theme_minimal() +
    scale_color_gradient(low = "red", high = "darkred")

```

You can improve this using **scale_size_area()**:
```{r}
ggplot(forCloud_ascending, aes(label = EachWord, size = Counts,color = Counts)) +
  geom_text_wordcloud_area(eccentricity = 0.65) +
  theme_minimal() + scale_size_area(max_size = 13)+ # try increasing
  scale_color_gradient(low = "red", high = "darkred")
```

Notice that the order of the data frame with counts matters:

```{r}
forCloud_descending=forCloud_ascending[order(-forCloud_ascending$Counts),]

#now

ggplot(forCloud_descending, aes(label = EachWord, size = Counts,color = Counts)) +
  geom_text_wordcloud_area(eccentricity = 0.7) +
  theme_minimal() + scale_size_area(max_size = 13)+ # try increasing
  scale_color_gradient(low = "red", high = "darkred")
```

You do not always work with tweets, but some simple text like this:

![](https://github.com/DACSS-Visual/basicText/blob/main/sometext.png?raw=true)


You can simply save that text as a **txt** file. Let me work with that file:

```{r, warning=FALSE}
LinkText="https://github.com/DACSS-Visual/basicText/raw/main/sometext.txt"
otherText <- read.delim(LinkText,header = F)

head(otherText)
```

Notice the rows were produced when a new line (paragraph) is found in the TXT file. Now, let's write the code to produce obtain each word:

```{r}
otherText_words=otherText %>%
               unnest_tokens(output=EachWord,
                             input=V1,# column of the texts
                             token="words")%>%
               anti_join(stop_words,
                         by = c("EachWord" = "word"))
# you get
head(otherText_words,20)
```
Now you can prepare a frequency table, let's learn **count** from **dplyr**:
```{r}
txtAsc_descending=dplyr::count(otherText_words,EachWord,
                               name='Counts',
                               sort = TRUE)
# let's subset:
txtAsc_descending=txtAsc_descending[txtAsc_descending$Counts>4,]

# result
head(txtAsc_descending,10)
```


```{r}

ggplot(txtAsc_descending, 
       aes(label = EachWord, 
           size = Counts,color = Counts)) +
  geom_text_wordcloud() +
  scale_size_area(max_size = 10) +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_color_gradient(low = "red", high = "darkred")
```

Barplots are useful:

```{r}
ggplot(txtAsc_descending)  + 
    geom_bar(aes(x=reorder(EachWord,Counts),y=Counts),stat = 'identity') + coord_flip()
```

Or, a little better:

```{r}
ggplot(head(txtAsc_descending,15))  + 
    geom_bar(aes(x=reorder(EachWord,Counts),y=Counts),stat = 'identity') + coord_flip() + 
    labs(x="") + geom_text(aes(label=paste0(100*round(Counts/sum(Counts),3),'%'),
                               x=EachWord,
                               y=Counts),
                           nudge_y = 2)
```
However, word clouds may help the audience engage more into the subject. But, notice that words require some advanced work (lemmatization/stemming) to finally capture the concept used in the text.
